<p><strong>The concentration of hydrogen ion in an acid and hydroxide ion in a base; per unit volume; shows the concentration of acid or base.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By mixing of acid to water, the concentration of hydrogen ion per unit volume decreases. Similarly, by addition of base to water the concentration of hydroxide ion per unit volume decreases. This process of addition of acid or base to water is called dilution and the acid or base is called diluted.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The dilution of acid or base is exothermic. Thus, acid or base is always added to water and water is never added to acid or base. If water is added to a concentrated acid or base a lot of heat is generated, which may cause splashing out of acid or base and may cause severe damage as concentrated acid and base are highly corrosive.</strong></p>
