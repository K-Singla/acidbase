<p><strong>The strength of acid or base depends upon the hydrogen ion concentration. If the concentration of hydrogen ion is greater than hydroxide ion, the solution is called acidic. If the concentration of hydrogen ion is smaller than the hydroxide ion, the solution is called basic. If the concentration of hydrogen ion is equal to the concentration of hydroxide ion, the solution is called neutral solution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>pH is a scale which quantifies the concentration of hydrogen ion in a solution. The range of pH scale is between 0 to 14.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The pH value decreases with increase in hydrogen ion concentration. If the value of pH is 0, this shows maximum hydrogen ion concentration. pH value equal to 14 shows lowest hydrogen ion concentration. pH value equal to 7 shows the hydrogen ion concentration is equal to hydroxide ion concentration.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A neutral solution, such as distilled water has value of hydrogen ion concentration equal to 7 on pH scale. The acidic solution has value of hydrogen ion concentration less than 7 on pH scale. The basic solution has value of hydrogen ion concentration greater than 7 on pH scale.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In pH scale &lsquo;p&rsquo; stands for &lsquo;potenz&rsquo;. Potenz is a German word which means &lsquo;power&rsquo; or &lsquo;potential&rsquo;. Here; &lsquo;H&rsquo; stands for hydrogen ion. Thus, pH means the potential of hydrogen or power of hydrogen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>pH is defined as the decimal logarithm of the reciprocal of the hydrogen ion activity (a(H<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;)), in a solution.</strong></p>
