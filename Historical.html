<p>
Burning of fossil fuels releases oxides of sulphur and nitrogen. Nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide form nitric acid and sulphuric acid on reaction with water. When rain droplets mix with these gases; present in atmosphere because of pollution; they form acid rain.
Acid rain causes damage to the historical monuments and other buildings. For example Taj Mahal, which is made of marble, is getting damaged because of reaction with acid rain. Marble is calcium carbonate which reacts with the acid and thus gets corroded.

Metal carbonate or metal hydrogen carbonate and acid are used in fire extinguisher to produce carbon dioxide gas. Acid and metal carbonate or bicarbonate are kept in separate chambers in a fire extinguisher. On emergency they are allowed to react with one another. The carbon dioxide gas so produce is poured over fire. As carbon dioxide does not support burning, it puts off the fire.
